# Introduction 

This folders contain code for my game in Java with using the library LibGDX. 
The game is in the initial stage of developing, because Iâ€™m working alone. If you clone it and run it in your Idea, you can have some fun

# Folders

1. `core/assets` - images for this project
2. `core/music` - songs for the game
3. `core/src` - folders with Java classes
4. `desktop/desktop` - Java launcher for the game
